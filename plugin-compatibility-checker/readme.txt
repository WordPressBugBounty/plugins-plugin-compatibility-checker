== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens if I don’t activate a license? =
You must subscribe to the $1/month entry plan and activate your license to see PHP 8.5 compatibility results. Without license activation, visibility will be limited. Pro unlocks dashboard analytics, notifications and vulnerability insights.

= Why does a plugin show “No Data”? =
This usually means the plugin is either custom/premium or its version has been removed from WordPress.org.

= Do I need to rescan after adding new plugins? =
Yes, please click **Rescan** to include new plugins in the compatibility check.
